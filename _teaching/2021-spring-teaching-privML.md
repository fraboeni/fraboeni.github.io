I organized and held the software project "Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning" with final year Bachelor and Master students from Freie University Berlin.
The goal of the project was to build a software library that allows non-privacy-expert machine learning (ML) practitioners to evaluate the privacy of their neural networks.
Additionally, the tool should help non-ML-experts who are in charge with system security to get an impression about the model privacy.
To evaluate the privacy, several attacks against ML models were implemented.
The outcome of the software project can be found in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/privML/privacy-evaluator).
All project management was done with Scrum where I acted as a Product Owner and the students as the Developer Team.
