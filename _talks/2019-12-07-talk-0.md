A science slam is a different way to present your research, which only has two rules: 1) You need to present something you are personally researching on, 2) The talk shall not exeed 10 minutes, 3) The talk should be entaining and understandable. I presented my research on Differential Privacy. **Find my talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWNC_qtqS-0).**
