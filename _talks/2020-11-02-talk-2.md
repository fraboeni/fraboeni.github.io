*Abstract:* With the growing amount of data being collected about individuals, ever more complex machine learning models can be trained based on those individualsâ€™ characteristics and behaviors. Methods for extracting private information from the trained models become more and more sophisticated, such that individual privacy is threatened. In this talk, I will introduce some powerful methods for training neural networks with privacy guarantees. I will also show how to apply those methods effectively in order to achieve a good trade-off between utility and privacy.
