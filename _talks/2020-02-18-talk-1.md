*Abstract:* 
Nowadays, machine learning (ML) is used everywhere, including in sectors that deal with extremely sensitive data, like health or finance. And while most companies do not deploy a single line of code anymore without being tested somehow, ML models are often let out into the wild without being checked or secured. In my talk, I will guide you through the long road of possible threats and attacks that your ML models might be experiencing out there, and give an overview what countermeasures might be worth considering.
